What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When I inittialize a reposotary, git creates some metadata files.
        I think, that in these files will be saved different state of my
  	project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allow you to specify which files should be commited.
	So,you can commit only the files you think they achived a new stage.
	Directory just holds all your files and git metadata and repositary
	holds just your files. I think that might be helpful.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	I can add in the staging area only the changed files that seems to me logicaly 
	connected and I'm able to make a commit  per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	I can make a new branch whenever I want to try to add an experimental feature
	or for example to make a new localization.The branches allow me to make 
	my official program be unchanged.   

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	When I draw a diagram I can better understand a structure of the branch,
	since I see the tree structure more precisely because when I'm running 
	git log --graph I can see only two branches of the tree from my expirience.  	

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	Changes of both branches will be combined.This allows us to automaticly
	add new features without a need for type them.We represent them this way,
	with a single parent for both of the branches, because the new state is a 
	combination of the states of the previous commits.
What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
	I think that it's pretty convinient that git can automaticly merge two branches,
	You don't need pay your attention or waste your time when there is no conflicts,
	i.e. simple cases.So, I can benefit from it saving my time.
