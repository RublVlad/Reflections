How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allow you to specify which files should be commited.
	So,you can commit only the files you think they achived a new stage.
	Directory just holds all your files and git metadata and repositary
	holds just your files. I think that might be helpful.

change?

	connected and I'm able to make a commit  per logical change.
