How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using diff I can easily track which lines of my code had changed since I
    wrote a new version and therefore track the bag.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can improve my style and thinking analysing my code in the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can make new versions whenever it seems to me that in that point my program 
    moved to a new stage. There will be more logic in those stages.
    With Google docs I can't forget to make a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git was created for programmers as I think and it understands that 
    a new version gain the entire program and not one separete file. A change in one
    file will affect the entire program.	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    A git log command shows me all the commits of my repositary and therefore
    different versions of my program.Using git diff I can see which changes 
    was applied to the previous version and differences between previous
    version and a new one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I use a version control system, I shall be sure that whatever change I shall
    make I always can roll back to the previous version and examine which changes 
    led to the error or just leave things as they are.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to create a repositary, start developing a program, make commits
    and see the differences between versions, catch some bugs using git.
